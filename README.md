# qt_tutorial
Just me working through the qt tutorial

Version in use is 5.15, MSVC 32 and 64 bit

I think this is the tutorial at:
https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Beginners#A_pretty_button
though I'm not certain now.

In the previous commits I've worked through small exercises then rolled them back.

My goal is to reach the point of being able to build a simple "dialog box" application.
